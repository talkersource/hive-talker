   ^YQUIZ^y lets you run quizzes for the other users to play, and lets you
   take part in other people's quizzes.

^W * Playing in quizzes^n

 Playing a Quiz is much easier than running one: the only subcommands you will
 need to use are ^Wjoin^n, ^Wanswer^n and ^Wleave^n. All subcommands are prefixed by the
 command name, ^Wquiz^n (so ^Wquiz join^n issues the join subcommand of the Quiz.)

   ^Yjoin^y                - lets you join in the current game.
   ^Yleave^y               - lets you leave the current game.
   ^Yanswer <answer>^y     - will submit ^W<answer>^n.

   ^C * ^Wanswer^c can be abbreviated to ^Wans^c.^n

^W * Running your own quiz^n

 As a Quizmaster, your task is slightly more difficult. You may ask questions
 using the ^Wquestion^n subcommand, or its abbreviation ^Wask^n. It is up to you to
 mark answers as correct using the ^Wtick^n subcommand. If you do not ^Wtick^n an
 answer, it will be treated as incorrect (although you can do this explicitly
 using ^Wcross^n, which can also be used to put right an incorrect marking.)

   ^Ystart^y               - lets you start a new quiz, as the Quizmaster.
   ^Yend^y                 - lets you finish a quiz.
   ^Yquestion <question>^y - begins a new round with the question stated.
   ^Ytick <player>^y       - marks the stated player's answer as correct.
   ^Ycross <player>^y      - marks the stated player's answer as incorrect.

   ^C * ^Wquestion^c can be abbreviated to ^Wask^c.^n
   ^C * ^Wtick^c can be abbreviated to simply ^Wy^c, for 'yes'.^n
   ^C * ^Wcross^c can be abbreviated to simply ^Wn^c, for 'no'.^n
