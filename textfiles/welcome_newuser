   Welcome new user. This is a talk server written from scratch incorporating
   the best features of other basecodes with its own unique commands. 

   The system was built with the ideas of equality, community, freedom and
   privacy at the forefront of our minds. You will find no staff here abusing
   their power, everyone can free themselves from abuse through an advanced
   ignore system.

   Type 'help start' for a getting started guide.
   Thank you for connecting, I hope you have fun using this system.
