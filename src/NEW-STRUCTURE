This is the proposed new structure for The Hive codes


CORE                     BASE PLUGINS               COMMAND PLUGINS
socket handling          string lib                 admin
plugin handling          user struct                bships
crash recovery           ulists                     elite
signal handing           command storage            gamebase?
main                     command parser             groups
                         core commands              help
                         file handling              info
                         textfiles                  noop
                         basecomms                  private
                         login                      profiles
                         tools                      quiz
                         history buffers            save
                         {lists}                    system
                         {aliases}                  user_settings
                         {editor}

At the moment most of the functionality listed in the BASE PLUGINS and CORE
sections are in the main executable. This means that any modifcations made
will require a hard reboot. To move this functionality to the current plugin
system will be difficult due to the restrictive nature of the dependancy 
system (ie no circular dependancies and all dependants must be unloaded before
a plugin can be reloaded)

The new design is an attempt to fix this issue. Only the bare essentials needed
to maintain connections, handle plugins and crash recovery will be in the main
executable. Everything else will be dynamically loaded. COMMAND PLUGINS will
be able to be individually reloaded as before because they will not have any
dependants. Reloading a BASE PLUGIN will be a bit more complicated because they
will almost certainly have one or more dependants. The easiest way to do it will
be the following:

Unload all COMMAND PLUGINS
Unload all BASE PLUGINS (in reverse order)
Reload BASE PLUGINS (in a specific order)
Reload COMMAND PLUGINS

This will give us the functionality of a soft reboot whilst maintaining the connections
as the small core program can always be running.
