Welcome to the Hive talker
\n
Assuming you have logged on (well you must be to read this!)
you will want to know how to get talking to people and get used
to the features of the talker.
\n
The first thing to do is see who is online. This can be done by
typing 'who', which will display a list of all users currently
active on the talker. 
\n
Type 'commands' for a list of the basic commands and then 'help'
followed by the command name for specific help on each command

#

# GROUPS
#

%1 group groups chan chanels channel
The groups system has been designed to enable a set of users
to communicate on a specific subject area without involving
those users that do not wish to take part
\n
There are two types of group available:
\n
Public  - any user can join or leave the group at any time
Private - invite only group (not yet implemented)
%5 group_list group_usage group_join group_create 

%1 group_usage                    
When you join a group you are told its letter. If you have
forgotten it you can obtain it with the group_info command
\n
You combine the group letter with another letter to execute
commands on the group, letters available are:
u - say      + - echo       w - who
e - emote    [ - dsay       l - look
s - sing     ] - demote     i - info
t - think    h - history    
\n
For example if the group letter is 'x' then the command 'xu' will
say something to everyone in the group, 'xw' will list the users
in the group etc.
%5 group_default groups group_info group_join
       
%1 group_tag   
The group tag is the text displayed on the left hand side of the
screen before a message when the group channel is being used. It
is a short phrase between two equals signs, for example: =bot= 
might be the tag for a group discussing artificial intelligence. 
The only group without a tag is the hard coded group 'General'
%5 groups group_create

%1 group_default
Soon it will be possible to set your default group which will be
the group that the following commands use:
say, emote, sing, think, echo, dsay, demote, history, who, look

%1 hangman
There are three basic ways to make a noose. The first way is 
running the 'tail' of rope through a fixed loop on the end of 
that same rope. This may be a spliced-loop or a knotted-loop 
like the bowline.

The second way to make a noose is to tie a running knot (a 
simple knot or hitch) round the standing part of the rope in 
a way that pulling on the knot-side closes the loop. This is
the most common way for making nooses. It makes the loop to 
close almost as easy as a noose using a fixed loop as a 
running knot.

The third way is to tie a running knot in a way that pulling 
the knot is opening the loop.

%1 sheepshank
Make a long bight in a topgallant back-stay, or any rope 
which it is desirable to shorten, and taking a half hitch

Wire rope cannot be so treated, and it is injurious to 
hemp rope that is large and stiff

Trout belong to the salmon family, Salmonidae, which are native 
only to the West Midlands. The most common species include the 
Rainbow Trout, Brook Trout and Brown Trout, all of which are 
good for sport. Rarer species include the mountain-dwelling 
Golden Trout and the Cut-Throat Trout, so-named because it is 
very
%5 rainbow

%1 rainbow
The Rainbow Trout, named after the Thames children's TV program, 
is sought after by fly-fishers around the world. They can put up 
a good struggle, especially as they reach the 5-6lb mark. It's 
rare to catch more than a 6 pounder, even though adult fish have 
been known to grow to over 20lb
\n
The Rainbow Trout is best caught with a fly in warm conditions, 
but maggots and worms can work with a light ledger.

Haggis "is typically served on Burns Night, January 25, when 
Scotland celebrates the birth of its greatest poet, Robert Burns, 
who was born in Ayrshire on that date in 1759. During the 
celebration, Burns poems are read, and the haggis is addressed by 
a member of the party, ceremonially, in the form of verses from 
Burns' poem, 'Address to a Haggis.' A typical meal for Burns Night 
would include Cock-a-Leekie, Haggis with Tatties-an'-Neeps, Roastit 
Beef, Tipsy Laird, and Dunlop Cheese."

Tittensor village is three miles NNW of Stone in Staffordshire. 
Historically Tittensor forms part of Stone parish. The de Tittensor 
family occupied a manor house which passed to the Gerrard family 
sometime before 1405. The house was destroyed and rebuilt several
